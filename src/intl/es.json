		"intro" : "“Aalto LAB Mexico (ALM) is an interdisciplinary and intercultural design-led project for social and environmental sustainability. It has been developed as a project-based learning experience, where feasible projects emerged directly and in coherence with a community called ‘20 de Noviembre’ (El 20), located in Campeche, Mexico.” - Claudia Garduño <br/> I was part of the ALM team since the project’s conception. ALM is the biggest and most complex project that I have ever been part of. Owing to the project’s highly interdisciplinary and intercultural basis, the team and the network started to grow quickly since its first year. I would never have imagined that an architect from New Zealand, an engineer from Finland and an industrial designer from Mexico would work together. This is how things are all the time. <br/> But what is ALM exactly? I think of it as an effort of making “El 20” a better place. In line with our aims, the project’s process and the structure of the LAB evolved and improved each year."
